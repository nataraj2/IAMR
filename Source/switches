NOTES to self:
1. FineAdd routines in AmrCore/AMReX_FluxRegister do not use tiling. Nor
   do they appear to work with OMP. Switching to YA would probably be
   really nice....but not ready yet

instead of figuring out the "right" way to get IAMR to execute certain lines of code,
can force execution by hacking and then compare MF/fab at end.

	  static int count=0;
	  ++count;
	  {
	    // read in result MF from unaltered version of code
	    std::string name2="../../../IAMR_old/Exec/run2d/aofsOld"+std::to_string(count);
	    std::cout << "Reading " << name2 << std::endl;
	    MultiFab mf2(aofs.boxArray(),dmap,aofs.nComp(),aofs.nGrow());
	    VisMF::Read(mf2, name2);
	    MultiFab mfdiff(mf2.boxArray(), dmap, mf2.nComp(), mf2.nGrow());
	    // Diff local MF and MF from unaltered code 
	    MultiFab::Copy(mfdiff, *aofs, 0, 0, mfdiff.nComp(), mfdiff.nGrow());
	    mfdiff.minus(mf2, 0, mfdiff.nComp(), mfdiff.nGrow());

	    for (int icomp = 0; icomp < mfdiff.nComp(); ++icomp) {
	      std::cout << "Min and max of the diff are " << mfdiff.min(icomp,mf2.nGrow()) 
			<< " and " << mfdiff.max(icomp,mf2.nGrow());
	      if (mfdiff.nComp() > 1) {
		std::cout << " for component " << icomp;
	      }
	      std::cout << "." << std::endl;
	    }
	    // write out difference MF for viewing: amrvis -mf 
	    std::cout << "Writing mfdiff" << std::endl;

	  if ((*aofs)[U_mfi].box().contains(mypt))
	      Print()<<"(*aofs)(0,0) "<<(*aofs)[U_mfi](mypt)<<"\n";
